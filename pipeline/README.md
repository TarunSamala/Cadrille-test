# Pipeline module map

The Project Bible v1.0 Phase 0-9 roadmap is canonical. Many module filenames
predate it, so this index prevents similarly numbered stages from being mixed.

## Bible implementation modules

- `phase1_ground_truth.py`, `phase1_review.py`, `stl1_phase1_review.py` - Bible
  Phase 1 evidence and identified human review.
- `run_phase3_geometry_benchmark.py`, `vggt_geometry_adapter.py` - Bible
  Phase 3 research benchmark infrastructure.
- `bible_phase_2_paired_benchmark.py` - Bible Phase 2 guided-capture,
  production-STEP, measurement, component-graph, split and provenance guardrail;
  inactive under the image-only execution profile.
- `image_only_reflection_correction.py` - active Ring01 reflection-sensitive
  inner-boundary correction with an explicit uncertainty mask.
- Phase 0 is primarily Docker, dependency, manifest and regression evidence.

## Shared evidence and dataset tools

- `prepare_jewellery_dataset.py`, `jewellery_multiview_dataset.py`
- `extract_dataset_complete_phase1.py`, `infer_dataset_depth_anything_v2.py`
- `audit_jewellery.py`, comparison and audit builders
- metadata, schema, validation-sheet and camera/depth support modules

Some shared filenames contain old phase labels because their generated
artifacts are immutable legacy evidence.

## Legacy Ring01 and dataset modules

Modules named `extract_phase1`, `extract_phase2*`, `refine_phase2*`,
`reconstruct_phase3`, `build_phase3*`, `refine_phase3*`, `validate_phase3*`,
`train_dataset_phases` and `reconstruct_dataset_phase3` implement the pre-Bible
pipeline. Keep them for regression and backtracking; do not infer Bible phase
completion from their names.

## Naming new work

Use `bible_phase_<number>_<capability>.py` when a new module is specific to a
Bible phase, or use a clear capability name when it is shared. Do not add a new
ambiguous bare `phase1`, `phase2` or `phase3` module.
